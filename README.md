# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction
A health insurance company intends to improve its revenue by cross selling vehicle insurance. To discover the potential value of this business, the corporate collected data including customersâ€™ information and their response to the new package. This project aims to build several models, train them with existing data, and select the one with optimal performance. The model will select healthcare members who are more likely to register for vehicle insurance, which could help company focus marketing resources mainly on potential customers for new services.
